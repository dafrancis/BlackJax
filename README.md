# BlackJax

## What is this?

BlackJax is a CMS that was originally written in PHP. I then decided to reimplement it in ruby using
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com). I've used BlackJax as the main CMS for [my website](http://www.somethingafal.com/)

## So what's the difference between this CMS and the gajillion others?

Well I suppose there's not much I can do to convince you why mine is better (to be honest I don't think
it is). I made this as an experiment to see if I could have a CMS that shows the content and manages the
content all on one page, making some silly JavaScript animations whilst doing so. The end result in my opinion
is quite satisfactory yet there are still a lot of stuff I want to work on such as theming and tweaking
the JavaScript a bit.

## What's new?

* Started the project and released the code instead of hoarding it myself

## To-Do

* Themes or Skins or Layouts or whatever is the best word for it
* TinyMCE seems to not work half of the time so I need to have a look at that
* Better Login

## How to use

1. Get the repository
2. Install bundler (gem install bundler)
3. Install the required gems with "bundle install"
4. Use rackup/passenger/unicorn/thin/whatever to run the application
5. ???
6. PROFIT

To get to the admin just go to /admin wherever your application is installed
